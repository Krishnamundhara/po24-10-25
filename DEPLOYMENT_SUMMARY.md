3. Configure: base=frontend, build=npm run build, publish=dist
4. Add VITE_API_URL environment variable
5. Deploy
```

### Method 2: CLI Deployment

**Backend:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
cd backend
railway login
railway init
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set DATABASE_URL=...
railway up
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
