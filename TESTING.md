## Reported Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Duplicate button clicks
**Solution:** Buttons are disabled during submission, this is working as intended.

### Issue: Search not showing results
**Solution:** Search is case-insensitive. Try different keywords.

### Issue: PDF looks different than preview
**Solution:** PDF uses server-side rendering. Preview is close but may differ slightly.

### Issue: Date picker not showing
**Solution:** Use browser's native date picker. Format is YYYY-MM-DD.
