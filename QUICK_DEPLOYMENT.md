## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Backend not starting** | Check Railway logs → Verify DATABASE_URL → Check Node.js version |
| **Frontend won't connect** | Check VITE_API_URL is correct → Verify backend CORS settings |
| **Database connection fails** | Check DATABASE_URL format → Verify Neon is active |
| **404 on API endpoints** | Check backend logs → Verify routes are deployed |

---

## 🔄 Update Process

Once deployed, updates are automatic:

```bash
# 1. Make code changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# 2. Services auto-redeploy
# Railway: Auto-detects git push
# Netlify: Auto-detects git push

# 3. Check deployment status
